# statistical-learning

This repository contains some of the slides about statistical learning
that I used in the 2017 and 2018 editions of _Stat 154_ at UC Berkeley.

The 2019 and 2020 editions of _Stat 154_ were based on the book
<a href="https://allmodelsarewrong.github.io">Concepts of Statistical Learning</a> (by Gaston Sanchez and Ethan Marzban).



## Donation

As a Data Science and Statistics educator, I love to share the work I do.
Each month I spend dozens of hours curating learning materials like this resource.

a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate?business=ZF6U7K5MW25W2&currency_code=USD" target="_blank">one-time donation---via paypal---in any amount</a> (e.g. the amount you would spend inviting me a cup of coffee or any other drink). Your support really matters.
